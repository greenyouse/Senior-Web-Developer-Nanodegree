# Senior Web Developer Nanodegree

I completed a series of five major front-end projects from Udacity's
Senior Web Developer Nanodegree last year. The first four focused on
different features of a progressive web app, like offline functionality,
accessibility, or web notifications. My final project was a culmination
of all the features to make a full progressive web app in vanilla
JavaScript.

I've been excited about the upcoming web components specification, so I
chose to use Polymer for my first four projects. Along the way I wrote my
[first public Polymer component](https://github.com/greenyouse/datetime-local-input)
and contributed a couple bug fixes back to the Polymer team.

## Project 5
Yum Foodz, *(September - October 2016)*

Created a recipe manager with progressive enhancement and page sizes under 10kB (excluding icons and 3rd party images). Makes use of ServiceWorkers for client-side routing, templating, push notifications, and storing recipes. Nodes.js was also used for server-side rendering and storing user data.

## Project 4 
Corporate Dashboard, *(August - October 2016)*

Polymer, Web Components, HTML5, JavaScript, CSS

Developed a corporate dashboard application with a geospatial view, a "key metrics" view and a "data view" using the Polymer Web Components framework. Used NodeJS, push notifications, and ServiceWorkers for updating the data in real-time.

## Project 3
Restaurant Reviews, *(July 2016)*

Accessibility, HTML5, CSS, WAI-ARIA

Built a restaurant review app with a focus on accessibility best practices like WAI-ARIA, landmark elements, and other features. Restaurant reviews and search results are shown using the Google Places API and geolocation. Service workers are also used to cache app resources.

## Project 2
Public Transportation, *(June 2016)*

HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Service Worker, Progressive Web Applications

Created a Polymer application for navigating the train system in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. It features offline-first functionality by showing directions, schedule info, and next departures times regardless of the user's network connection. Service workers were also used to cache app contents.

## Project 1
Meet-up Event Planner, *(March - May 2016)*

HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, touch input, Progressive Web Applications

Created a responsive web application with Polymer that allows users to establish a meet-up event. The application makes use of the latest best practices in developing high conversion web forms, including new input type elements, compound form components, data validation, and handling touch input.
